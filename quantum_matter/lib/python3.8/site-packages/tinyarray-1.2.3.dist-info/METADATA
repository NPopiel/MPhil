Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.
Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than with
NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times less
memory is used to store them.  Tinyarrays are useful if you need many
small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.
(The resulting code is still much slower than C, but it may now be fast
enough.)

Unlike Python's built-in tuples, Tinyarrays support mathematical
operations like element-wise addition and matrix multiplication.  Unlike
Numpy arrays, Tinyarrays can be used as dictionary keys because they are
hashable and immutable.

The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and thus should be
familiar to many.  Whenever an operation is missing from Tinyarray,
NumPy functions can be used directly with Tinyarrays.
