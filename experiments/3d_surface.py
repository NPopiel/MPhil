# Plot a 3d surface of resistance, B, I,
# Heat plots
# Skype with alex hickey, differentiation of the different forms (inverted shape for VT49)
# Also talk to him about harmonics
# T, B, I, R
# Non linear IV
# 7 K weird thing happened
# Resistance v field ge slope



# Resistance as a function of field,
 Plot the gradient over the ntercept of the linearly fitted RvB curve for each T for each I (sum of lss)
i.e. R = aB+b plot a/r

fit with np.polyfit


After linear fitting the data, plot! Should be similar to ratio plot

# re save files, use constant temperature and constant current as folders
saving only R and B
